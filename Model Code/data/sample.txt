Type of Attack: Benign
Attack Count: 1862
DST IP Address: 192.168.143.3
DST Port: 80
Attack Category: Normal
Protocol: 6
Description: Normal network traffic exhibiting no signs of malicious behavior.

Anomaly or Benign: Anomaly
Type of Attack: DDoS_SYN
Attack Count: 1834
DST IP Address: 192.168.143.3
DST Port: 12345
Attack Category: TCP-based Exploitation DDoS
Protocol: 6
Description: This is a TCP-based exploitation DDoS attack exploiting connection-based protocols (e.g., SYN floods, HTTP floods) to exhaust server resources. Enable SYN cookies, use stateful firewalls, and apply rate-limiting.

Anomaly or Benign: Anomaly
Type of Attack: DDoS_UDP_Lag
Attack Count: 2243
DST IP Address: 192.168.143.3
DST Port: 12345
Attack Category: UDP-based Exploitation DDoS
Protocol: 17
Description: This is a UDP-based exploitation DDoS attack where direct UDP floods overwhelm target systems with traffic. Use rate-limiting, deploy DDoS protection services, and implement traffic filtering at the perimeter.

Anomaly or Benign: Anomaly
Type of Attack: DrDoS_DNS
Attack Count: 1252
DST IP Address: 192.168.143.3
DST Port: 12345
Attack Category: TCP/UDP-based reflection DDoS
Protocol: 17
Description: This is a TCP/UDP-based reflection DDoS attack using misconfigured or open services (like DNS, LDAP, NetBIOS, SNMP, Portmap) to amplify traffic. Secure the services, restrict access, apply rate-limiting, and block spoofed traffic.

Anomaly or Benign: Anomaly
Type of Attack: DrDoS_UDP
Attack Count: 1875
DST IP Address: 192.168.143.3
DST Port: 80
Attack Category: UDP-based Reflection DDoS
Protocol: 17
Description: This is a UDP-based reflection DDoS attack where services like CharGen, NTP, TFTP, and generic UDP reflect large responses to spoofed requests. Disable unused UDP services, restrict access, and implement anti-spoofing measures.
