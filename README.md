# Multi-Class DDoS Detection Using LSTM Autoencoder and DNN

## Overview

This project presents a complete pipeline for real-time detection and classification of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It leverages deep learning techniques, combining an LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection and a DNN for multi-class attack classification. The solution is based on realistic traffic data and supports real-time deployment scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Simulation**: Simulates various DDoS attack types in a virtualized environment.
- **Traffic Capture**: Utilizes CICFlowMeter for feature extraction from raw network traffic.
- **Two-Phase Detection**:
  - **Phase 1**: LSTM Autoencoder trained on normal traffic to detect anomalies.
  - **Phase 2**: Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier to identify specific attack types.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Provides visualizations of traffic patterns, anomalies, and predicted attack classes.
- **Low Latency**: Inference time ~0.28 ms/sample, suitable for high-throughput environments.
